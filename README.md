## Overview

The Lynx CoC aka Compiler on Crack was almost entirely made up by me.
What do I mean by that? Well I have no clue how a compiler works and this
entire thing was coded on the basis of "I think thats how it works" or
"Thats how I'd do it". Yet somehow it does...
#### On that note, you shouldn't take this as an example for how compilers work.

## Does it Work?

No... at least not yet. It can generate a beautiful ast though... depending on what you call beautiful.

TL;DR its WIP
